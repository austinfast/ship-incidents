		<h2 class="data-box-head">About the data</h2>
		<p class="data-box-text">The USA TODAY/AP/Northeastern University mass killing database contains information on incidents, offenders, victims, and weapons for all multiple homicides with four or more victims killed in the United States from 2006 to the present.</p>
		<h3 class="data-box-subhead">Definition</h3>
		<p class="data-box-text">Mass murder is defined as the intentional killing of four or more victims— excluding the deaths of unborn children and the offender(s)—by any means within a 24-hour period. This definition includes cases involving all weapons (e.g., shooting, blunt force, stabbing, explosives, etc.), types (e.g., public, felony-related, and familicides), motivations (e.g., domestic dispute, profit, revenge, terrorism, hate, etc.), victim-offender relationships (e.g., stranger, family, acquaintance, co-worker, etc.), and number of locations. The time frame of 24 hours was chosen to eliminate conflation with spree killers who kill multiple victims over several days in different locations, and to satisfy the traditional requirement of occurring in a “single incident,” even if that incident involves an offender targeting multiple locations in an extended assault but within a relatively short time span. However, offenders who kill four or more victims during any 24-hour period of time as part of a multi-day spree are included as are all their victims within seven days of the mass killing. Negligent homicides related to driving under the influence or accidental fires are excluded due to the lack of intent. Finally, only incidents occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia are included in the database.</p>
		<p class="data-box-text">Consistent with the traditional definition, fatal mass shootings are those mass killings (four or victim fatalities) in which most or all the victims are killed by gunfire. This differs from the alternative definition used by the Gun Violence Archive that includes incidents in which at least four victims are shot regardless of whether the injury is fatal. Less than five percent of these shootings are mass killings as defined here. Our definition of a fatal mass shooting also differs from an active shooter event which, as characterized by the FBI, involves an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area. Less than 25 percent of active shooter events result in four or more victim fatalities so as to constitute a mass killing.</p>
		<h3 class="data-box-subhead">Methods</h3>
		<p class="data-box-text">Researchers at USA TODAY first identified potential incidents using the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Homicide incidents in the SHR were flagged as potential mass murder cases if four or more victims were reported on the same record, and the type of homicide was coded as “murder or non-negligent manslaughter.” Cases were subsequently verified utilizing media accounts, court documents, academic journal articles, books, and local law enforcement records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Each data point was corroborated by multiple sources, which were compiled into a single document to assess the quality of information. When sources were contradictory, official law enforcement or court records were used, when available, followed by the most recent media or academic source. Case information was subsequently compared with other available mass murder or mass shooting databases to ensure validity. Incidents listed in the SHR that could not be independently verified were excluded from the database.</p>
		<p class="data-box-text">In 2016, primary data collection and verification efforts shifted from USA TODAY to Northeastern University. Northeastern researchers conducted extensive searches for incidents not reported in the SHR during the time period, utilizing internet search engines including Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and Newspapers.com. Search terms included: [number] dead, [number] killed, [number] slain, [number] murdered, [number] homicide, mass murder, mass shooting, massacre, rampage, family killing, familicide, and arson murder. Offender, victim, and location names were also directly searched when available. Northeastern University researchers also independently verified data collected by USA TODAY staff and filled in missing information, sometimes involving updated reports pertaining to older cases.</p>
		<p class="data-box-text">In December 2018, a Memo of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the Associated Press, USA TODAY, and Northeastern University to formalize a joint initiative to maintain and expand the mass killing database previously housed at USA TODAY. The Associated Press hosts the database and maintains the data entry tool, USA TODAY has developed and maintains the public website for the database, and Northeastern University manages data collection and updates.</p>
		<p class="data-box-text">The full database currently consists of four linked data tables with a total of 59 data fields (not counting indicators for the availability of offender/victim identity)—18 fields for each incident, 20 fields for each offender, 13 fields for each victim killed, and 8 fields for each weapon used. Most variables, with the notable exception of victim names, are available for public download. The remaining data are reserved for individuals affiliated with the Associated Press, USA TODAY/Gannett, and Northeastern University’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and others by permission of all three organizations. Moving forward, additional variables may be added to the full database as well as the public subset.</p>
