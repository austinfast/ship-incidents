      "text": "Report 1: London, Nov 8 -- A press report, dated Nov 7, states: Passenger (cruise) <i>Spirit of Discovery<\/i> (IMO: 9802683), which ran into trouble in �gale force winds and nine metre high waves� on Nov 6: The vessel was forced to cut short a cruise returning to the United Kingdom on Nov 6, with reports of as many as 15 percent of the passengers aboard having been injured and five taken as a precaution to hospitals. The vessel was caught in a fierce Bay of Biscay storm taking the unusual step of going �hove to� in the storm to reduce further injuries and danger for the passengers. The vessel was on a two-week trip from Portsmouth, England to the Canary Islands. The vessel had completed most of its trip, although it was forced to forgo a stop at Las Palmas due to the worsening weather. The vessel had planned to make a port call in La Corona in northwest Spain on Nov 5, but it was forced to skip that stop as well when the port closed due to the bad weather. The vessel turned north toward the UK but became caught in a fierce storm in the Bay of Biscay. By some reports, the waves were running between 30 and 45 feet with winds up to 70 metre per hour. Reportedly, most of the injuries were minor but there were reports of lacerations with some people requiring stitches and broken bones. Between 100 and 150 passengers were reportedly injured. <i>Spirit of Discovery<\/i> returned to Portsmouth on the evening of Nov 6, about 12 hours ahead of schedule, and five passengers were transferred to a hospital as a precaution according to the company. The vessel departed as scheduled on Nov 7, heading to Ponta Delgada in the Azores as the first stop on a month-long cruise to the Caribbean.\nReport 2: London, Nov 6 -- A press report, dated today, states: Passenger (cruise) <i>Spirit of Discovery<\/i> (IMO: 9802683, 58119 gt, built 2019), ran into trouble in �gale force winds and nine metre high waves� this midday before getting battered for the next 18 hours. Of the 100 people injured, five sustained more severe injuries and needed treatment at the vessel�s medical centre. They are due to go to hospital when Discovery docks at Portsmouth International Port. The vessel is expected in this evening with people set to disembark tomorrow, though those seeking medical attention will be able to go to the hospital this evening. The incident happened when the vessel's propulsion safety system activated at 1230 hrs, and turned the vessel resulting in injuries to around 100 of the 1,000 passengers on board. Passengers then spent around 18 hours waiting for the storm and gales to pass after the Master took a decision to hold the position. <i>Spirit of Discovery<\/i> was on a 14-night Canary Island Quintet cruise, which departed on Oct 24. But with weather conditions worsening, a decision was made on day 10 to cancel a call to Las Palmas and continue onwards to La Coruna to get ahead of the approaching storm, a Saga spokesperson said. But while cruising towards La Coruna, the Master was told the port would be closed due to bad weather conditions. A decision to return back to the UK earlier than planned was then made to stay ahead of the storm. Shipping forecasts showed that either turning back or taking any alternative route would have meant hitting the stormhead and conditions would have been much worse, a spokesperson for Saga said. ",

      "text": "Report 1: London, Mar 19 -- A press report, dated today, states: According to reports, the Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority reprimanded passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, saying it was \"a ship�s length from running aground.� The vessel left the northern city of Tromsoe carrying almost 1,400 people, despite storm warnings, it was headed for Stavanger in southern Norway when it experienced engine problems amid a storm on March 23, 2019, and issued a mayday call. The vessel was anchored in heavy seas to avoid being dashed on the rocks in an area known for shipwrecks. Passengers witnessed a large wave crashing through glass doors, and nearly 480 passengers were evacuated by helicopter despite challenging weather conditions. The captain eventually decided to halt the evacuation, and about 900 people remained on board as the vessel limped into the Norwegian port of Molde under its own engines. Dozens of people were injured during the vessel�s harrowing ordeal, including 36 who were admitted to hospitals. Norwegian authorities immediately launched a probe into the incident, which concluded today, that the vessel was unprepared to sail in rough seas. �The accident was caused by insufficient lubricating oil in all of the operating diesel generators� lubricating oil sump tanks, in combination with pitching and rolling in rough seas,� investigators wrote. The investigation has identified operational, technical, and organizational safety issues that contributed to the blackout in different ways. \"<i>Viking Sky<\/i> did not comply with the applicable safety standards, it should not have departed Tromsoe under the prevailing circumstances,� the report said.\nReport 2: London, Apr 9 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> which experienced main engine problems at Hustadvika More og Romsdal county on Mar 23, sailed from Copenhagen Apr 7 and arrived in Oslo, at 0516 hrs, UTC, today.\nReport 3: Kiel, Apr 5 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> arrived in Copenhagen at 1020 hrs, today to start its next cruise as scheduled. -- Correspondent.\nReport 4: Kiel, Apr 3 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, after the final inspection by the class confirmation the vessel started its voyage from Kristiansund towards Copenhagen, at 1540 hrs, today with an estimated time of arrival at 1000 hrs, Apr 5. -- Correspondent. \nReport 5: Kiel, Apr 3 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>: According to reports, the Norwegian Maritime Directorate is on board the vessel in order to check with the classification company whether the damages have been rectified. It is understood that, the damages were repaired either by replacement or by temporary repairs. -- Correspondent.\nReport 6: Kiel, Mar 27 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> safely berthed in Kristiansund, at 1640 hrs, today. The vessel will be repaired in the Vestbase Yard there. Meanwhile it became known that the engines of <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, had failed because of relatively low levels of lubricating oil in the engines. All four engines had failed, but the crew managed to restart one of the engines just in time. The conclusion of the Norwegian Maritime Authority was that the engine failure was directly caused by low oil pressure. The level of lubricating oil in the tanks was within set limits, however relatively low, when the vessel started to cross Hustadvika. The heavy seas probably caused movements in the tanks so large that the supply to the lubricating oil pumps stopped. This triggered an alarm indicating a low level of lubricating oil, which in turn caused an automatic shutdown of the engines. Viking Ocean Cruises upon these findings have inspected the levels on all the sister ships and were now revising procedures to ensure that this issue cannot be repeated. -- Correspondent. \nReport 7: Kiel, Mar 27 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>: Reportedly, the towage of the vessel was a precaution due to the missing anchors on the vessel. Regarding the two anchors, one had to be cut when the vessel regained engine power and another lots its wings. The vessel is towed to Kristiansund, where the shipping company will begin repairs of the vessel, while the Accident Investigation Board will continue their investigations into the incident. -- Correspondent.\nReport 8: Kiel, Mar 27 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> sailed the port of Molde being towed by offshore tug <i>Normand Ranger<\/i>, at 0620 hrs, today. The vessel is bound to Kristiansund with an ETA at 1900 hrs, today. -- Correspondent.\nReport 9: Kiel, Mar 26 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>: It was found that, when the vessel set sail, there was a storm along the Norwegian coast, and the waves were too high to use lifeboats for emergencies. The situation usually occurs only a few times in a year. On March 25, divers were in the water to investigate the vessel for damage, but also to ascertain whether the cooling water intake had stopped or otherwise been damaged. There were no signs of this. The same day it also emerged that the crew was not able to raise one of the two anchors, while one of the main engines was started, and the captain wanted to sail further away from the coast. The crew had to cut the anchor to enable the vessel to sail away. Nine passengers were hospitalised with injuries, and one 90-year-old woman, who was in a critical condition, has improved but has multiple fractures. Norwegian authorities continued their investigation of <i>Viking Sky<\/i> today, on what caused the four engines to fail at the same time. -- Correspondent.\nReport 10: London, Mar 25 -- A press report, dated today, states: Norwegian authorities today began investigating why passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, was sailing in stormy weather when it developed engine trouble that triggered a perilous helicopter evacuation effort for hundreds of terrified passengers over the weekend. \"We don't know the reason why the vessel sailed knowing such bad weather was forecast,\" Kurt Olsen, an acting director for Norway's Accident Investigations Board, said. \"We have a very good weather service in this country, so I would guess the crew knew everything about the forecast. How they responded will definitely be part of the investigation.\" Twenty-eight people were treated for injuries and nine remained hospitalized one critically, authorities said today. \"The vessel drifted to within 100 metres of running aground before they were able to restart one of the engines,\" Hans Vik, Chief of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre for southern Norway, said \"If they had run aground we would have faced a major disaster.\" Olsen would not speculate why the Viking Sky captain decided to sail despite the weather warning. He said ship operations were one part of the investigation, along with a technical study of why the engines failed and third review of how the rescue was handled. \"It's really early in the investigation, so we just don't know much yet,\" Olsen said. Yngve Skovly, a police inspector in the Molde region, said there was no suspicion of criminal behaviour and that the vessel was too new to suspect maintenance problems. But he said crucial information could be obtained from the ship's computer logs. Torstein Hagen, Chairman of Ship Owner Viking Ocean Cruises, said his company would conduct its own investigation and support government agencies reviewing the mishap. All passengers were expected to be flown out of Norway by today night, police said. \"The last few days have been both dramatic and hectic for guests and crew on board Viking Sky,\" Hagen said in the statement. \"I would like to apologize for all our guests for what they have been through.\"\nReport 11: Kiel, Mar 25 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> was boarded by technical experts from Lloyd's and the Norwegian Maritime Directorate this morning, for the investigation of why the four main engines failed simultaneously in a two-year-old vessel, assuming it was built according to regulations and specifications. <i>Viking Sky<\/i> is covered by the rules in the Safe Return to Port regulation of Solas, which involves doubling up on all important equipment. The vessel�s four main engines are supplied by MAN, and are placed in two separate engine rooms. According to reports, possible explanations for the cause of the incident include overheating of the engines caused by air sucked into the cooling system, which in turn could have been caused by waves as high as fifteen metres. The waves could have also caused precipitates in the fuel tanks leading to the engines not getting enough fuel. Until the cause has been determined, the vessel will remain at Molde. Passengers are being flown home. Out of the 1,373 people aboard the vessel, 17 were taken to a hospital. The next cruise of the vessel has been cancelled. -- Correspondent.\nReport 12: Kiel, Mar 24 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, was safely berthed in Molde, at 1620 hrs, today. Four tugs took the vessel into the Molde-Fjord with tug <i>Ocean Response<\/i> at the bow and <i>Vivax<\/i> as steering at the stern. In Molede the vessel is to be surveyed. Depending on the length of investigations and the amount of repairs required it was to be decided whether the 915 passengers will have to return home. The cruise was scheduled to end in Amsterdam on Mar 27. The same day the vessel was due to sail via Hamburg to Kiel. Whether this cruise may start as scheduled was depending on the surveys of the engines. -- Correspondent. \nReport 13: London, Mar 24 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>, arrived at Molde, Norway at 1554 hrs, today.\nReport 14: Kiel, Mar 24 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>: About 460 people were flown ashore with almost 1000 people still on board. Tugs <i>Normand Responder<\/i>, <i>Ocean Response<\/i> and <i>Vivax<\/i> are towing the stricken vessel to Molde, Norway. -- Correspondent.\nReport 15: London, Mar 24 -- A press report, dated Mar 23, states: Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i>: Rescue workers off Norway�s western coast rushed to evacuate 1,300 passengers and crew members from the disabled cruise vessel by helicopter on Mar 23, winching them one-by-one to safety as heaving waves tossed the vessel from side to side and high winds battered the operation. <i>Viking Sky<\/i> issued a mayday call as bad weather hit and engine problems caused it to start drifting toward the rocky shore. Police in the western county of Moere og Romsdal said the crew members, fearing the vessel would run aground, managed to anchor in Hustadvika Bay, between the Norwegian cities of Alesund and Trondheim, so the evacuations could take place. Rescue teams with helicopters and boats were sent to evacuate the cruise vessel under extremely difficult circumstances, including gusts up to 38 knots (43 miles per hour) and waves over eight metres (26 feet). The area is known for its rough, frigid waters. Most of the cruise vessel�s passengers were reportedly British and American tourists. About 180 people have been evacuated, according to rescue officials.\nReport 16: Trondheim, Mar 23 -- Passenger (cruise) <i>Viking Sky<\/i> (47842 gt, built 2017), experienced main engine problems at Hustadvika More og Romsdal county, at 1400 hrs, today. The vessel is anchored. Reportedly, there is no pollution. The passengers presently are being winched ashore by three helicopters. The coastguard is attending. -- Lloyd�s Agents (Bachke & CO A/S).",

The court heard the case on Mar 22 and ruled two weeks later that it did not fall within the jurisdiction of the summary proceedings judge and must be addressed by the administrative judge. Prior to taking this step, Koole requested a meeting with the ILT. In principle, the ILT is not opposed to returning the vessel to service. It was decided that Koole would remove enough fire-damaged steel from the ship to eliminate any \"waste iron.\" The ILT will then conduct another inspection. Although Chinese authorities still need to issue an entry permit for the vessel under the new circumstances, it was assumed that this would not be an issue. The repair work was expected to take two to three months. -- Correspondent.\nReport 2: Kiel, Apr 5 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26, 2023, is not allowed to be taken to China for the time being. This was evident from the summary judgment in the judge's ruling today after the owner KMS filed a lawsuit against the state. In the summary proceedings, the judge expressed that the administrative judge was the competent authority. Based on a complete record, this judge can assess whether <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> is just trash, as the state believes, or a vessel that can be transported to China. That judge declared Koole's claims inadmissible, which is a bitter setback for Koole, the new owner, who has renamed <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> to <i>Floor<\/i>. Delays have already cost Koole 121,000 Euros. In addition to the tug, a special transport vessel was also available to transport <i>Floor<\/i>. Every day longer at the quay in Rotterdam costs Koole 29,000 Euros. Since the devastating fire, the Human Environment and Transport Regulatory Agency (ILT) has determined that <i>Floor<\/i> is no longer a vessel but waste. Therefore, due to European legislation, it is not allowed to go to China for repairs, as Koole wanted. To prevent <i>Floor<\/i> from having to be scrapped, Koole went to court. The judge in the urgent proceedings decided today that a so-called notification procedure was the right way to properly assess the condition of the vessel. All important information is then presented. According to the Hague judge, the fact that Koole believes that there is no waste does not change this. If the ILT claims that the vessel is waste, Koole can object and appeal to the administrative court. While the appeal is being processed, Koole may apply for an interim measure at short notice to obtain an interim court decision on the matter. According to the Hague judge, the new owner of the vessel can still have the ILT's position assessed by the administrative law judge, who specializes in such issues, in a relatively short period. That's why the path to civil court is blocked. Koole bought the vessel, which was towed from Eemshaven to Rotterdam, for the symbolic amount of one Euro from the Japanese owner Luster Maritime and plans to have it repaired and resold. An agreement for a sale worth 11 million Euros has already been signed with the Chinese shipyard Qingshan. -- Correspondent. \nReport 3: Kiel, Mar 19 -- The Dutch company Koole, the owner of vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which caught fire on July 26, 2023, off Ameland, Netherlands, has initiated summary proceedings against the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate (ILT). The company aims to transport the vessel to China for repairs and eventual sale to a Chinese shipyard. However, the ILT has withheld permission, deeming the vessel as waste and unsuitable for transport to China due to its non-membership in OECD countries. The case will take place in the court in The Hague court on Mar 22. Currently, <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> remains berthed at the Damen shipyard in Botlek. Koole acquired the vessel in Oct 2023, from its Japanese owner, Luster Maritime, for a nominal sum of one Euro. Subsequently, Koole removed all car wrecks from the vessel and transported them to the final processor. According to Koole, the vessel is technically in order and an agreement has already been signed with a Chinese shipyard for a sale of 11 million Euros. Koole anticipates an eight-month repair timeline upon arrival in China. The company has a deal with Luster Maritime. Koole receives the first three million Euro while the remaining eight million Euros are to be split evenly with the former owner. Transport expenses, totalling five million Euros, will be covered by the Chinese buyer and shipyard. According to Koole there is no question of the vessel being waste, and experts have been on board, including Van Damen, who have confirmed that the vessel is in excellent condition and can be repaired, as a new vehicles carrier can cost as much as 160 million Euros with a shortage of these types of vessels, so it would not be a sustainable solution and would destroy capital if the vessel would be demolished. In response, the ILT emphasizes adherence to international laws and regulations. According to the inspection, Koole should have been aware of the vessel's inability to be transported to China in its current state. -- Correspondent.\nReport 4: Kiel, Jan 12 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26, 2023, and was towed to the Damen Verolme Ship repair in the Botlek in Rotterdam, further clean-up work is currently taking place at the shipyard, and some parts of the vessel are also being dismantled. The new owner of the vessel is the Netherlands-based company Koole Contractors, which specializes in industrial demolition, renovation and wreck removal. Its experts were now investigating which parts of the structure have been weakened by the extreme heat of the fire. Koole will then remove parts of the vessel's structure and replaces them with new parts. The repair work is primarily limited to the upper part of the vessel between the decks 5 and 12, as the lower decks, where 500 electric cars were stored, and the engine room were hardly damaged by the fire. However, Koole will not operate the vessel after the repair work has been completed but will instead sell the vessel to a potential operator. Detailed plans for the repair and subsequent use of the vessel are still being discussed. The goal is to ensure that <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> is put back into operation in optimal condition. Koole is currently assuming that the vessel will be ready for use again at the end of January, with several interested parties for the operation of the freighter. The cause of the fire is still unclear. Emergency services reported at the time that the fire had broken out in an electric car, but this has still not been confirmed. The investigation by the Dutch Coast Guard is currently still ongoing. -- Correspondent.\nReport 5: London, Nov 10 -- A press report, dated Nov 9, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> has been moored in the Botlek at Damen Verolme Rotterdam BV since the end of September. The vessel is undergoing refurbishment by the company KOOLE Contractors. Dozens of buyers have already come forward who are interested in taking over <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. The vessel and the salvage and dismantling process are so special because the most important parts of the vessel, such as the engines and the pumping systems, have remained largely intact despite the severity of the fire. The fire raged above the waterline. A representative from KOOLE Contractors, the provisional owner, explained, \"The fire mainly raged between deck number five to deck number twelve. But decks one through four are the most important of the vessel, which have remained virtually intact. That's where the engines, the machinery, the pump systems are, so they're also the most valuable,\". This means that <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> can still be repaired. The company is now in the process of removing the burnt-out cars from the vessel. He stated, \"These are taken down by our guys and put in containers for further processing. Another team is cleaning the engine rooms and repairing and maintaining the machines.\" He added, \"It's quite a long and difficult job, we'll be working on it for at least a few months. There are a lot of vehicles on board, so it's a lot of repetitive work, and also long-winded.\". Reportedly, the vessel is expected to be ready for full repairs early next year.\nReport 6: London, Nov 7 � A press report, dated Nov 6, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: Reportedly, 100 days after the outbreak of the fire on <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>, the future of the burned-out unit remains uncertain. The vessel is currently moored at a dock of the shipbuilder Damen in Rotterdam. At the moment, it is still being investigated whether a repair of the vessel is possible, said a spokesman for the company. The investigation into the cause of the fire would also be ongoing. As a result of the fire, the upper decks were completely destroyed, and many vehicles merged with the decks. Accordingly, it is difficult to investigate the causes and assess whether the damaged vessel can be rebuilt. The owner is said to be pursuing a corresponding plan, but the assessment of whether this could work economically is still pending. Initially, experts had assumed that the fire had broken out in an electric car. This has not yet been confirmed. Many of the electric cars were stowed unharmed on the lower decks. Above all, it had burned over it. \nReport 7: London, Oct 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: A powerful explosion on board <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> may have caused the fire on the car carrier. The explosion was so violent that it may have deformed the vessel on the starboard rear.�And new facts about electric cars on the disaster vessel, fuel doubts as to whether�the fire started in a plug-in car. Research must show whether this explosion caused the fire after which the vessel was in great distress above Ameland at the end of Jul or whether a raging fire led to this serious explosion. <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> was deposited�in dock 5 of Damen Verolme�in Rotterdam, this evening.�Koole Contractors,�temporary owner of the vessel, will carry out clean-up work and inspections there.�The company expects the work to take about four to five months.�It is still unclear what happens to the vessel afterwards. Meanwhile, in Eemshaven, car manufacturers�last week�started removing cars from being transported by <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>.\nReport 8: Kiel, Oct 13 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>: The car manufacturers have picked up cars from the vehicle carrier, which had experienced a fire, off Ameland, on the night of Jul 26. About 980 intact cars could be unloaded from the vehicle carrier, which will be repatriated by BMW and Mercedes this week. It will be brought back to the factory by truck. -- Correspondent. \nReport 9: Kiel, Oct 8 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: The vessel arrived in dock No. 5 of Damen Verolme in Rotterdam during the evening hours of Oct 6. The docking was the result of collaboration between Damen, the pilotage service, the Royal Rowers' Association De Eendracht, Boluda Towage, Port of Rotterdam, and Koole Contractors. Due to the draft of the vessel, the time of the maximum high water had to be used to tow the vessel into the drydock. -- Correspondent.\nReport 10: Kiel, Oct 4 -- Vehicles carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>, which caught fire on the night of Jul 25, off Ameland, has been bought by the Dutch Koole Contractors with the intention of reselling the vessel ready to sail early next year. Everything on board is currently being cleaned up.  After a contingent of cars could be driven out of the vessel from a number of undamaged decks in Zeebrugge, it was towed to Damen Shipyard in Rotterdam on Sep 21. The Dutch Koole Contractors has rented space there to clean up the chaos on the damaged decks, some parts of which have collapsed. Koole Contractors will completely empty the vessel and inspect which parts can be repaired. Once all information is known, parts of the structure will be demolished, and the remainder prepared for repairs and new construction. Demolition will likely be limited to the upper part of the vessel. The undership sustained little. After the repair works which may possibly take place at another shipyard, the vessel will be sold to a new owner. -- Correspondent.\nReport 11: London, Oct 2 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, the next phase of the salvage operation for the fire-damaged <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> is now underway. Regulators are continuing their investigation to determine the cause of the fire that destroyed or damaged as many as 2,800 vehicles and the top decks of the vessel while a plan for its salvage is also being prepared. KOOLE Contractors, an international industrial and maritime service company based in the Netherlands that specializes in industrial demolition, remediation, wreck removal, and maritime construction, has taken control of <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. KOOLE reportedly made an agreement with the Japanese owners of <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> taking ownership and overseeing the second stage of the salvage efforts. They have formed a team that is carrying out structural inspections to determine which sections of the vessel need to be removed and replaced due to the fire. Reports are that sections of the structure from decks 5 to 12 were weakened by the extreme heat of the fire but that the lower decks and machinery spaces were undamaged. As part of developing the plan for <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>, the team from KOOLE also plans to further inspect the tanks to determine what remains aboard the vessel. Teams from the Port of Rotterdam and DCMR Environmental Service Rijnmond, the environmental service of the province of South Holland and thirteen municipalities in the Rijnmond region, boarded the vessel to undertake an initial inspection after it reached Rotterdam. They have given environmental clearance, and a plan is now being developed for the next phase of the salvage operation. KOOLE will submit its plans to the Dutch regulators for approval.\nReport 12: London, Sep 29 -- A press report, dated Sep 27, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, Netherlands-based Koole Contractors has become the new owner of the fire-damaged <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. Koole Contractors will be looking to repair the vessel and sell it to a willing customer. The vessel will first be further emptied because there is still an uncertain amount of cargo on board. At the same time, an extensive inspection and inventory will be carried out, and Koole will then develop a repair plan. The general manager of maritime projects at Koole, said that experts would examine which parts of the structure had been weakened by the heat. Steel loses elasticity when exposed to extreme heat. Once a full inspection is made, Koole will demolish parts of the structure and prepare it for repairs and new construction, with demolition probably being limited to the upper part of the vessel due to the lower decks sustaining very little damage. <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> arrived at Damen Shipyard for repairs in Botlek on Sept 23, almost two months after a fire broke out on the vessel.\nReport 13: Kiel, Sep 29 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26 and�was towed by tug <i>Multratug 3<\/i> (IMO:�9537408) and <i>EN Avant 25<\/i> (IMO:�9949443), has been berthed at�Damen Verolme in Rotterdam-Botlek. The�DCMR and the Port of Rotterdam Authority have been on the vessel to assess the situation�concerning environmental and safety risks.�The�DCMR saw no indications that a nuisance may arise outside the facility due to the presence of the vessel.�The new owner planned to restore the vessel.�An action plan will be drawn up for this, which will be submitted to the government authorities for assessment.�If everything goes ahead, the vessel may enter the dock at Damen Shipyards Botlek in a week and a half. -- Correspondent. \nReport 14: London, Sep 25 -- A press report, dated Sep 23, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: The vessel sailed from Eemshaven for Rotterdam on Sep 21. Tugs for this order were <i>Multratug 3<\/i>�and <i>En Avant 25<\/i>. The vessel arrived in Rotterdam on Sep 23, after two days of sailing from Groningen's Eemshaven, almost two months after a fire broke out on the freighter. The vessel is taken to Damen Shiprepair in the Botlek where it is partially dismantled to carry out repair work.\nReport 15: London, Sep 21 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: The burned down vessel will leave for Rotterdam, this afternoon.�The vessel is expected to arrive at Damen Shiprepair in Botlek on the afternoon of Sep 23. Koole Contractors will then starts working on the vessel.\nReport 16: Kiel, Sep 21 -- Vehicle carrier Fremantle Highway (IMO: 9667344) which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: The vessel will be taken to the port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, this afternoon. The vehicle carrier is to be further dismantled in the port. The vessel is currently still in the Eemshaven in Groningen but must be removed from there because the quay will be needed again in October. The intention is for the vessel to be towed away at 0300 hrs so that it can be out of the harbour mouth around 0400 hrs. -- Correspondent.\nReport 17: London, Sep 9 -- A press report, dated Sep 8, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, the salvage operation to remove cars and debris from the fire-damaged <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> has been completed. It is thought that as many as 1,000 vehicles may have been removed, mostly from the lower decks of the vessel, and many appeared undamaged while others were burned, and at least one caught fire on the dock. \"We have returned the ship to the owner,\" a spokesperson for Boskalis, which was leading the salvage operation with Multraship, said on Sep 8. Boskalis acknowledged that at least one car thought to be electric caught fire while it was being removed from the vessel. During the salvage operation, all the cars were washed to remove any chemicals or residue from the fire before they came off the vessel. Others damaged in the fire, or possibly the EVs, were being hoisted off by crane. The cars were being placed in a secure lot on the dock for insurers to determine their fate while the wash water was contained on the vessel for proper disposal. The lower decks were less impacted, while cars on the upper decks were reportedly heavily charred, and many melted into the decks. Portions of the decks are reported to have been weakened in the fire, making them unsafe for access now. Reportedly, the vessel was expected to remain for the next few weeks in the ports of Eemshaven, but port executives are saying it must leave by Oct 14. The berth where it is sitting has reportedly been promised to a cruise vessel, likely <i>Carnival Jubilee<\/i>, which is due to make the conveyance from Meyer Werft in Papenburg and will be completed before handover to Carnival Cruise Line.\nReport 18: London, Aug 31 -- A press report, dated Aug 30, states: Vehicle carrier�<i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>�(IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: A car caught fire while unloading cars on the freighter <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. Reportedly, while moving an electric car with water damage, a reaction occurred in the battery, causing a fire. The vessel is located in the Eemshaven in Groningen, Netherlands. About two weeks ago, recovery crews from Smit Salvage and Boskalis�started�disembarking cars from the vessel that caught fire last month. On board the transport vessel were 3784 cars. More than 2700 vehicles that were on the upper decks were lost in the fire and are still on the vessel. The cars on the lower four decks were still�reasonably intact�after the fire and have now all been disembarked. The car that caught fire, yesterday, was one of the last cars on the lower decks, salvage company Smit Salvage reports. Groningen Seaports, which includes Eemshaven, says that the fire was quickly under control. The fire brigade of the salvage companies was already on the site. When the car was removed from the vessel, flames came out from underneatht and the vehicle was immediately lifted into a container with water. The port says it was surprised by the fire. Smit Salvage reports that there is no reason for panic and that the unloading of the cars on the cargo ship can continue as usual. The salvage company thinks it will take about ten more days to unload the burned out cars on the upper decks.\nReport 19: London, Aug 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, rescuers found many cars on board <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> that the fire did not reach and are in relatively good condition. Therefore, a decision was made to remove these vehicles from the vessel. This action is aimed at minimizing the damage incurred by the shipowner and the company to which the vehicles belonged. The lack of operational cars will also facilitate later work, when burnt, often melted wrecks will have to be removed from the vessel. Reportedly, the first cars that managed to get out of the vessel drove ashore via a special loading ramp. Each of the vehicles had to be washed before leaving the vessel. It was difficult to say what exactly was burning there and whether there were any toxic substances in the dust and soot. Therefore, the machines were washed. This was done on board so that the water after such washing did not get into the natural environment. And so, it will remain on the vessel, it will go to the bilge, from which it will then be extracted and cleaned by special companies dealing with this type of operation. After washing, these cars are transported to a specially prepared and protected car park in the port area. From then on, it will be up to the owner of this wheeled load and the inspectors from the insurance companies to decide what happens to the vehicles. It was also reported that it is possible that these cars will go on sale in some form. If not entirely, at least in part. The action of unloading undamaged vehicles is expected to take about a week. Later, people will probably board the ship to remove the wreckage. Parallel to the unloading of the cars, the cause of the fire is still being determined. This was not the case with electric car batteries, according to reports.\nReport 20: London, Aug 19 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: Salvage companies started with the removal of cars from the burned-out vessel, this morning. The vehicles are being removed from the vessel via a car wash that was installed on it, recovery companies Boskalis and Multraship said through a spokesperson. The vessel was carrying 3,784 cars, nearly 500 of which were electric. It eventually emerged that about a thousand vehicles on the lower four decks still appeared in good condition. The upper decks were severely damaged and many cars that were parked were essentially fused to the decks. The cars are being washed on board for environmental reasons. The water being used to wash the vehicles will be collected and disposed of afterwards, according to the salvage companies. After the cars have passed through the mobile car wash, they will be disembarked and parked in a specially protected area in the port. From that moment on, it is up to the owner of the cargo and the inspectors to determine what happens to the cars. Boskalis and Multraship expect the entire operation to take more than a week. During that period, they want to disembark all cars from the lower four decks. The cause of the fire is still not clear. As salvage companies, Boskalis and Multraship were not willing to comment on a possible cause of the blaze.\nReport 21: London, Aug 15 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to the salvage company, it was probably not - as previously assumed - one of the 498 electric cars on board that caused the fire. According to reports, <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> was loaded with almost 3,800 new passenger cars, of which 498 were electric cars. But all the electric cars were, according to the director of the salvage company Royal Boskalis, among the between 900 and 1,000 cars that appear to be in good condition.\nReport 22: London, Aug 15 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: The cause of the fire is still unknown. The damage to <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>is clearly visible. Shipping fuel on board <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> is expected to be removed from the vessel today. The spokesperson said on behalf of the salvage companies involved with Boskalis and Multraship. The so-called bunkers, where the vessel�s oil is stored, were kept stable by pumping close to the ballast water. Damage experts have been appointed by the insurance companies involved to investigate the cause of the fire. Boskalis estimated that more than 2,700 burnt and often melted vehicles cannot be removed from <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. The review is still ongoing. Inside the vessel were more than 3700 cars from BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen, among others. Five hundred of them will be electric. There were also Rolls Royce�s on board.\nReport 23: Kiel, Aug 14 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: There was no final plan yet how to proceed with the cars aboard <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>, in Eemshaven. The�salvage company on Aug 10, found that about a thousand vehicles on the lower four decks of the vessel are still in good condition and perfectly towable.�However, it is not certain that these vehicles will actually be removed from the vessel, due to the risk�the cars catching fire again because of the towing, with all the misery starting all over again.�For the 2,700 other cars on board, which are heavily damaged, it is certainly questionable whether they will be removed from the vessel.�Part�of the upper decks�have completely merged with the cars. The decks are very badly damaged and difficult to access. As of today, diving support <i>Multrasalvor 4<\/i> (IMO:�8224286), fire fighting tug <i>Multratug 20<\/i> (IMO:�9572006)�and chemical tanker <i>Vantage<\/i> (IMO: 9430909)�were alongside <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>, in the Juliana Port in Eemshaven. -- Correspondent.\nReport 24: Rotterdam, Aug 10 -- Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: According to reports, dated Jul 26, states: A salvage vessel has managed to establish an emergency connection with <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> north of Ameland. With this connection, the salvage vessel <i>Hunter<\/i> keeps the vessel in a controlled position, the Coast Guard reports. According to a Coast Guard spokesman, the emergency connection is necessary to maintain control over where the vessel is going. \"It is rudderless, there is no one on board anymore,\" said the spokesperson. It is also dangerous because there was still fire on board. As far as possible, a location that is as safe as possible, between two traffic lanes, has been chosen and every effort is made to keep the vessel clear of obstacles at sea. The connection made is not very solid, according to the spokesperson, but it was the only thing possible at the time. The connection at the rear of the vessel will in any case remain until a possibly stronger towing connection can be made. <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> was still on fire, according to the Coast Guard, which previously indicated that one of the possible scenarios is that the vessel sinks. According to the spokesperson, this scenario is the most taken into account in the preparations that are now being made. \"At the moment, several parties such as salvage companies and Rijkswaterstaat are looking at the best possible way to limit the damage as much as possible.\" According to the spokesperson, the authorities absolutely want to prevent liquids from ending up in the water as fuel. \"We're doing everything we can to prevent that.\" The vessel has 2857 cars on board, 25 of which are electric cars. The fire was first detected near electric cars. Whether it originated there and why, is still unclear. The electric cars make firefighting more complex, according to the spokesman, because batteries are not so easy to extinguish. Multraship is the salvage operator. -- Lloyd's Agents (Interlloyd Averij BV).\nReport 25: London, Aug 10 -- A press report, dated today, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: More than 2,700 burnt-out cars cannot be removed from <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i>. Dredger and maritime service provider Boskalis believe that it was too dangerous to work on the vessel's burnt-out decks. They have largely collapsed, and the salvagers were afraid that they will collapse further. According to Boskalis, the cranes for clearing all wrecks cannot be in Eemshaven in time. <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> may remain at the quay of the Julianahaven until Oct 14 at the latest. From Oct 15, that place is reserved for another vessel. It is not yet clear where the vessel will go after that. Inspections have shown that the upper decks of the vessel have been most affected by the extreme heat. On the bottom four decks, where according to Boskalis, no fire has broken out, the cargo still appears to be reasonably in good condition. It would concern about 1000 cars that can still drive or roll. It also turned out that the engine room was still intact. Boskalis is now working on an action plan to disembark the cars on the lower decks. Reportedly, to this end, it will first be checked whether the loading ramp of <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> is still working. The cars can be driven or towed to the quay via this valve. The cause of the fire is still being sought. The Dutch Safety Board is assisting the Panamanian authorities in this.\nReport 26: London, Aug 10 -- A press report, dated Aug 9, states: Vehicle carrier <i>Fremantle Highway<\/i> (IMO: 9667344), which experienced a fire in the North Sea off the Netherlands on Jul 26: Some of the crew should look at the engine room. They are on their way back to Eemshaven, then to discharge the 1,600 tons of heavy fuel oil in a few days. Then Panamanian officials fly in, and they are responsible for investigating the fire.

A French naval vessel fighting off combat drones. And seafarers navigating through the looming risks of encountering Somali pirates. These are the scenes from a perilous mission that began soon after missiles attacked <i>True Confidence<\/i> on Mar 6. Tug <i>Red Bull<\/i> experienced a serious engine malfunction soon after started towing the vessel on Mar 10. As <i>True Confidence<\/i> drifted toward Somalia at a speed of about one to two miles an hour, the search for a replacement tugboat became more frantic. The owner of <i>True Confidence<\/i> received special permission from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) on Mar 12 to use <i>Hercules<\/i>, which was docked in Somalia, in the salvage mission, owner True Confidence Shipping SA and operator Third January Maritime Ltd. said in a joint statement on Mar 21. <i>Hercules<\/i> was instructed to tow <i>True Confidence<\/i> to Djibouti, a nearby safe port, on Mar 13. However, weather conditions soon worsened, and the choppy waters broke the tow line between the vessels on Mar 15. Once the vessels were reconnected, they set off again for Djibouti. Yet as they neared the port limits they were told the request for entry had been denied. �Following refusal by the Port of Djibouti to grant port of refuge, the tow has continued in a north-easterly direction away from the high-risk area, with the intention of seeking refuge at the port of Duqm,� the shipowner and operator said in a joint statement on Mar 20. As of Mar 27 evening <i>Hercules<\/i> and <i>True Confidence<\/i> were still on their way to Duqm in Oman, which has dry dock facilities that are used for salvage and repairs. Once there, the agency that provided the crew will locate the remains of the seafarers for repatriation to the Philippines, said Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega.

      "text": "Report 1: London, May 12 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, crews are expected to move forward Monday with a plan to use small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the Baltimore bridge after poor weather conditions forced delays on Saturday and Sunday. Officials are tentatively scheduled to carry out the controlled demolition around 1700 hrs, EST, today, according to the United States Coast Guard. Reportedly, it was originally slated to take place Saturday, but officials on Friday announced it would be postponed due to an adverse weather forecast. The project was delayed again on Sunday after lightning was spotted near the site, according to reports.\nReport 2: London, May 12 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i>: After weeks of preparation, crews are scheduled to conduct a controlled demolition today to break down the largest remaining span of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, which came crashing down under the impact of the massive vessel on Mar 26. The steel span landed on the vessel�s bow after it lost power and crashed into one of the bridge�s support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore. Since then, the vessel has been stuck among the wreckage and Baltimore�s busy port has been closed to most maritime traffic. \nReport 3: London, May 11 -- A press report, dated May 10, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, bulk carrier <i>JY River<\/i> (IMO: 9845269) exited the port via a temporary channel on May 9. Reportedly, bulk carrier <i>Klara Oldendorff<\/i> and another coal carrier stranded by the bridge collapse, remains moored at the Baltimore port.\nReport 4: London, May 11 -- A press report, dated May 10, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428): The authorities leading the recovery operation in Baltimore have declined to comment on the timeline for the next steps, including the removal of the vessel, only stating that systematic preparations are underway and that they remain on target to open the full channel by the end of the month. According to reports, an email indicates that the vessel will be moved to the dock on or about May 14 and handed over to investigators. The Unified Command has alerted the media of a tentative plan, subject to weather and other conditions, for the controlled demolition of the section of the bridge on the bow of the vessel. It is scheduled for this afternoon, with teams prepared to use giant claws to remove the sections, which should fall into the water around the vessel. The goal has been to lighten the forward section of <i>Dali<\/i> to refloat the vessel. Reportedly, the vessel will be moved to the Seagirt Marine Terminal in the effort to reopen the channel. The chief executive of the Dredging Contractors of America reports that dredgers will be standing by in case they need to remove mud to free <i>Dali<\/i>. The team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to reboard <i>Dali<\/i> on May 14 and 15 to continue their investigation. The NTSB has already interviewed the crew and the Maryland pilot who was guiding the vessel at the time of the allision and has reviewed onboard data. A preliminary report providing an updated statement of the facts is expected to be released in the coming days, possibly shortly after they reboard the vessel. Lawyers and investigators involved in the various lawsuits, including one from the City of Baltimore, have been told they can schedule visits to the vessel after the NTSB. The report states that there will be two groups taken aboard, with the vessel available starting May 20. They are being warned that the bow areas of the vessel may not be accessible as the recovery operation will still be underway. It is unclear if the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) plans to return to the vessel. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the week that the FBI is involved in an investigation to see if the crew violated a United States law, which states that a ship�s officer or crew can be charged with manslaughter if their negligence or misconduct led to the death of the six road workers who were on the bridge. The United States House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has also scheduled a hearing for May 15 to discuss the federal response to the bridge collapse. They have scheduled witnesses from the United States Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Highway Administration, and the NTSB. With the sections of the bridge removed from <i>Dali<\/i> and then the vessel removed from the area, the chief executive says dredgers are prepared to complete the task of restoring the channel. Salvage crews will continue to remove the debris from the bridge, while this week they recovered the body of the last of the six missing workers from the road crew.\nReport 5: London, May 9 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i>: Explosives will be used to remove a section of a bridge in Baltimore that has pinned a vessel to the riverbed. The Key Bridge Response Unified Command plans to use small charges to make precise cuts that will split the large section of the truss at specific locations, creating smaller pieces that can be removed by cranes and barges already on the scene. The steel truss on the deck of the vessel is more than 150 meters long, and 18 meters wide, and weighs over 5,000 tonnes. The controlled demolition method is considered a standard tool for removing wreckage and is aimed at reducing risks to personnel and clearing the channel for the Port of Baltimore. The process is expected to take several days and is dependent on cooperative weather. Earlier plans to have the vessel removed by tomorrow now appear optimistic.\n\nReport 6: London, May 8 -- A press report dated May 7, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: Salvage teams have recovered the body of the sixth victim died in the Baltimore bridge collapse, authorities announced on May 7, marking a grim milestone in the weekslong recovery operation that followed the disaster.\nReport 7: London, May 7 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: The Unified Command plans to utilize explosive charges to dislodge <i>Dali<\/i> from the debris of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. During the detonation process, the vessel's crew will remain on board, sheltering in place. Petty Officer of Unified Command explained that the explosives will be strategically detonated to separate a large section of the Key Bridge resting on <i>Dali<\/i>'s bow. Unified Command has assessed that it is safe for the crew to stay aboard <i>Dali<\/i> during the detonation and evacuation is not required. However, details regarding the crew's location on the vessel during the explosives' deployment were not disclosed. He mentioned that the explosives employed for freeing <i>Dali<\/i> will resemble those utilized in the demolition of the Gov. Harry W. Nice Bridge in Mar 2023. The placement of precision explosives on the bridge truss is anticipated to be a multi-day endeavor, contingent upon weather conditions, tides, and safety considerations. He specified that a press release will be issued 48 hours before the planned demolition, with media coverage invited. On Apr 30, the Port of Baltimore announced a target date of May 10 for the removal of the truss, the refloating of <i>Dali<\/i>, and the establishment of a 45-foot deep channel for ship traffic. Additionally, the port indicated that a permanent 700-foot wide, 50-foot deep channel would be operational by the end of May. \nReport 8: London, May 7 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: An update from Key Bridge Unified Command said salvage crews continue to prepare for the complex task of removing the road piece on top of <i>Dali<\/i>. Ahead of the removal, experts must analyse the state of multiple hazards caused by the vessel's allision with the bridge. \"Crushed containers, hull damage, and weight shifts are among the critical considerations crews must address during the bridge removal and refloating operation of the vessel,\" said Unified Command. Sensors are in place to measure any changes to the position of key locations on the span and vessel and to assess any changes in stress as salvors continue to work on the vessel and bridge debris.\nReport 9: London, May 4 -- A press report, dated today, states: The 20 Indian members of the crew of fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428) remain on board the vessel 35 days after the vessel allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26 that claimed the lives of six men who were working on the bridge at the time. A crew member who was injured received treatment ashore and returned to the vessel the day after. The crew is on board the vessel, which is the scene of investigation by United States authorities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has launched a criminal inquiry into the incident, separate from probes underway by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation. A request to interview the crew or obtain a written statement from any of them was turned down out of respect for the investigation. Experts have said the sailors could remain on the vessel for a few more weeks or even months. When they are allowed to leave, the junior sailors will be prioritized. The senior members are in for a long stay on the vessel, which is stationary in the water as engineers cut away parts of the collapsed bridge lying across its bow, the front part. Authorities expect to refloat the vessel by May 10 and dock it. It will remain there for the duration of the investigations.\nReport 10: London, May 4 -- A press report, dated May 3, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: The temporary 30-foot channel that allowed larger vessels to transit Baltimore Harbor has been closed as authorities focus on operations to remove <i>Dali<\/i>. However, local businesses have already begun to suffer. Maersk advised customers that, despite being unable to deploy larger vessels in the area, it would 'continue to operate limited barge services' through a temporary channel with a controlling depth of 20 feet. It is estimated that the 30-foot channel will reopen on May 10. Baltimore-based American Publishing has commenced legal action against the vessel�s owner, Grace Ocean (GO), and ship manager Synergy Marine (SM), claiming it incurred 'significant revenue losses' in the 'immediate aftermath of the Key Bridge�s destruction'. The strategic position of the bridge was vital to local businesses. The local business community, stunned by the event, ceased communications, resulting in a sharp decline in service calls and sales for the claimants. \nReport 11: London, May 3 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, salvage crews are working Friday to remove a massive piece of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge off the bow of the vessel. It's a complex, delicate operation that requires careful handling of roadbed material, crushed containers, and bridge fragments, the Unified Command said. Crews used cranes to remove 182 containers from the ship over the last four weeks to facilitate the removal of the bridge section. Reportedly, crews plan to refloat and remove the grounded vessel within roughly the next 10 days, allowing more maritime traffic to resume through Baltimore�s port. Officials expect to have it removed by May 10, according to a news release Tuesday from the Port of Baltimore.\nReport 12: London, May 3 � A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i>: The cost of rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore which collapsed on Mar 26, after the vessel allided with one of its support pillars will be between $1.7bn and $1.9bn. Maryland transportation officials say they estimate that the reconstruction will finish in the fall of 2028. \nReport 13: London, May 2 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, Chubb, the insurer of <i>Dali<\/i> is preparing to pay 350 million United States dollars to the US state of Maryland and is expected to approve the sum within weeks. A criminal investigation is continuing after <i>Dali<\/i> hit the pillar of the bridge. The body of a fifth construction worker inside a truck was recovered on Wednesday. The sixth worker remains unaccounted for. The broker for the Francis Scott Key Bridge�s insurance policy, WTW, confirmed the potential payout, according to reports. It is likely to be the first of many payments related to the disaster with damage to the bridge alone set to be more than one billion. Reportedly, Baltimore�s mayor has filed legal papers claiming negligence by ship manager Synergy Marine and shipowner Grace Ocean saying the vessel was unseaworthy when it left the port. City officials alleged that alarms went off on the vessel�s refrigerated containers before it left port, indicating an inconsistent power supply on the vessel. Chubb is expected to support any action by the city authorities and families of the victims in the legal action. The shipowner and manager earlier went to court in an attempt to limit their liability for the accident.\nReport 14: London, May 1 -- A press report, dated Apr 30, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428): Maryland's governor reported on Apr 30, that progress is being made in clearing the shipping channel at Baltimore's Key Bridge, where <i>Dali<\/i> struck a pier and caused the structure to collapse on Mar 26. According to a statement from the Port of Baltimore, officials are optimistic that the vessel could be removed by May 10. Since the cleanup efforts began, responders have removed over 3300 tons of steel from the channel, including several 300-500 ton sections of the main span. The East Coast's largest floating crane is onsite to handle these large lifts, and the unified command is proceeding cautiously to ensure safety. The next major lift involves removing the section trapping <i>Dali<\/i>. The temporary shipping channel next to <i>Dali<\/i> will be closed for the next 10 days as salvors prepare to extract this twisted segment from the vessel's bow. Contractors will make precise cuts to remove the section without further collapse. In the meantime, contractors are using a massive 1,000-ton hydraulic claw to retrieve tangled piles of steel girders from the bottom, avoiding the need to send down divers for each lift. The unified command expects to restore a control depth of 45 feet when the channel reopens on May 10, nearly matching its pre-accident depth. While the main ship channel is under repair, three temporary shallow channels will remain open for tug and barge traffic. Full restoration of the 50-foot channel is anticipated by the end of May.\n\n\nReport 15: London, Apr 30 -- A press report, dated Apr 29, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, 171 commercial vessels had transited the four alternate channels, and 137 containers of the estimated 180 necessary to access the portion of the bridge atop <i>Dali<\/i> had been removed as of Apr 26. To address the estimated 50,000 tonnes of wreckage at the Francis Scott Key Bridge site, the Unified Command has assembled a substantial fleet of diverse vessels and equipment, which includes 36 barges, 27 tugboats, 22 floating cranes, 10 excavators, one dredger, one skimmer, and three Coastguard cutters.\nReport 16: London, Apr 26 -- A press report, dated Apr 25, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, the Captain of the Port (COTP) opened the Fort McHenry Limited Access Channel for commercially essential vessels at 0800 hrs, Apr 25 until 0600 hrs, Apr 29. As with the other temporary channels, this new channel has been marked with lighted aids to navigation and will be limited to transit at the discretion of the COTP and based on the prevailing weather conditions. The Fort McHenry Limited Access Channel will have a controlling depth of 38 feet, a 300-foot horizontal clearance, and vertical clearance of 214 feet due to the adjacent BG&E powerlines. Deep draft vessels utilizing this channel will require a Maryland State pilot and two escort tugs, ahead and astern on centerline. The Maryland Pilots will impose a three-foot under keel clearance (UKC) requirement for all vessels and limit transits to winds being less than 15 knots. Due to this channel�s proximity to the grounded <i>Dali<\/i> and effects of a passing vessel, all transits must be at or below five knots. Additionally, each vessel requesting to transit this channel must provide their length, breadth, drafts (fore and aft), and total displacement to be assessed for potential impacts to <i>Dali<\/i>. For planning purposes, vessels greater than 60,000 long tons of displacement will most likely not be allowed to transit. Vessels less than 50,000 long tons of displacement will likely be allowed to transit, and vessels between 50,000 and 60,000 long tons of displacement will be closely evaluated by the Unified Command�s Marine Transportation System (MTS) Recovery Branch. Reportedly, the fourth vessel, bulk carrier <i>Phatra Naree<\/i>, stranded in Baltimore Harbour, has cleared the wreckage and is out in the Atlantic, following the opening of a deeper channel. A fifth vessel is expected to depart later today. Other ships are scheduled to enter the port, which normally processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.\nReport 17: London, Apr 25 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, two hours after the port and U.S. Coast Guard officially opened the deepest draft, limited access channel, general cargo <i>Balsa 94<\/i>, the first vessel made the transit at 1000 hrs, local time and at least two more have followed. Vessels can only transit at less than 5 knots. However, the Coast Guard this morning reported the final depth of the channel is 38 feet, although the port is requiring at least three feet of clearance. The departures appear to be coming at approximately two-hour intervals. General cargo with container capacity <i>Saimaagracht<\/i> cleared the channel at midday bound for Port Cartier, Canada. Third out is vehicle carrier <i>Carmen<\/i> which had completed offloading and was preparing to sail when the bridge collapsed. Port officials said on Wednesday that the priority during the approximate four-day window, while the temporary channel is available, is for vessels in the harbor that have been waiting to depart. Port Captain said earlier in the week that seven vessels were ready to leave and five were expected to go including the car carrier. He also reported that a smaller bulker and a vessel carrying aluminum were scheduled to arrive. They will use the deeper channel to enter Baltimore while container barges and smaller vessels are being instructed to continue to use the 20-foot channel. Reportedly, bulk carrier <i>Klara Oldendorff<\/i> and bulk carrier <i>JY River<\/i> require a deeper draft and will have to wait until the 50-foot channel is restored.\nReport 18: London, Apr 25 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, the fourth, and largest, channel opened in the Port of Baltimore this morning to allow larger vessels passage, but it's only temporary because large pieces of the bridge still need to be removed. The new channel is 35 feet deep and 300 feet wide. This limited access channel is open ahead of schedule as it was promised by the end of April. This allows vessels that have been stuck in the Port of Baltimore to get out. The Coast Guard said the channel is expected to close either Monday or Tuesday and remain closed until approximately May 10 to allow them to keep clearing the debris. Reportedly, general cargo <i>Balsa 94<\/i>, one of the stranded vessels in Baltimore, passed through the newly opened deep-water channel guided by two tugs, one in front and one behind. Crews are still on track to open the port to normal capacity by the end of May. The permanent channel needs to be 700 feet wide and 50 feet deep.\nReport 19: London, Apr 24 -- A press report, dated Apr 23, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, Baltimore has sued the operators of <i>Dali<\/i> and is asking the United States District Court of Maryland for a jury trial to hold the defendants fully liable. The vessel's Singapore-based owner and manager have already asked a court to limit their liability. Reportedly, naming the vessel's owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and its manager, Synergy Marine Private Limited, the suit alleges the Francis Scott Key Bridge's collapse was a direct result of their gross negligence and recklessness, and as a result of the unseaworthiness of the vessel. On Apr 1, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine petitioned the same federal court in Maryland to cap their responsibility for the incident. Citing a pre-Civil War maritime law, the pair of companies estimated their liability for the vessel and the cargo's value at 43.6 million United States Dollars (35 million Euros). Monday's court filing from the city of Baltimore rebuts that number as substantially less than the amount that will be claimed for losses and damages arising out of the vessel's allision with the Key Bridge. The city's representatives said the vessel had been experiencing an inconsistent power supply that was either not investigated or not fixed. \"<i>Dali<\/i> left port anyway, despite its clearly unseaworthy condition,\" said the lawsuit. The filing also says <i>Dali<\/i> was manned by an incompetent crew that was inattentive to its duties and lacked proper training. On Friday, port officials opened a third temporary channel for vessels to enter and exit the corridor, but these channels can only sustain about 15 percent of pre-collapse commercial activity. A fourth channel, that will allow most traffic back into the port, is expected to open by the end of the month.\nReport 20: London, Apr 24 -- A press report, dated Apr 23, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428) which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: The U.S. Coast Guard dropped buoys in the Patapsco River in Maryland on Apr 22, and Apr 23, to mark a new �limited access� channel for essential boat traffic following the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Footage shows coast guard crews working near and passing through a gap in the collapsed Baltimore bridge. According to the US Coast Guard, the limited access channel will open later this week for �commercially essential vessels.� The channel �is planned to have a controlling depth of at least 35 feet, a horizontal clearance of 300 feet, and a vertical clearance of 214 feet,� according to the Army Corps of Engineers.\nReport 21: London, Apr 24 � A press report, dated Apr 23, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i>: Officials in Baltimore are planning to open a deeper channel for commercial vessels to enter and leave the city's port, commencing on Apr 25. This is a significant step toward reopening the major maritime shipping hub that has been closed to most traffic since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed last month. The new channel will be 35 feet (12 metres) deep, which is a substantial increase over the three temporary channels established in recent weeks. The cleanup effort is slightly ahead of schedule, as officials previously stated they hoped to open a channel of that depth by the end of this month. Five of the seven cargo vessels that have been stuck in Baltimore's harbour will be able to pass through the new channel, including one loaded car carrier, officials said on Apr 23. This marks one month since the deadly disaster. Other vessels are also scheduled to enter the port, which normally processes more cars and farm equipment than any other in the country.\n\n \n\n \nReport 22: London, Apr 23 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428): Baltimore filed a legal claim on Apr 22, against the owner and manager of <i>Dali<\/i>. Attorneys for Baltimore's mayor and City Council accused both companies of providing the vessel with an \"incompetent crew\" that lacked proper skill and training. The city is seeking unspecified damages from both companies. The claim says that <i>Dali<\/i> left port despite indications that it had an inconsistent power supply. \"As the Mayor stated in his announcement, the City is pursuing its legal claims against those responsible for the Key Bridge catastrophe to ensure that the City, its residents, and its businesses are adequately compensated for their losses. As this matter is now the subject of active litigation, we will reserve further comment for the appropriate judicial forum,\" the Baltimore City Law Office told. \nReport 23: London, Apr 23 -- A press report, dated Apr 22, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: The owner and operator of the container vessel that took down the Francis Scott Key Bridge last month should not be allowed to skirt liability for the deadly collapse because the vessel was �unseaworthy� when it left port, attorneys for the city of Baltimore asserted in court filings on Apr 22. The bridge�s collapse was caused by �negligence of the vessel�s crew and shoreside management,� the city claimed in court documents filed in United States District Court in Maryland. Days after the incident, the vessel�s owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and manager, Synergy Marine Pte Ltd., filed a petition in the United States District Court in Maryland, asking a judge to cap how much money they could be asked to pay in liabilities at about $43.6 million. But attorneys for the city said that there should be no such cap, because liability cannot be limited if there is evidence of fault and an allegation they made could be proven at trial. The city also made several broad claims against the owners and operators of <i>Dali<\/i>, asserting they had failed to properly train the vessel�s crew, follow safe work and operational procedures, properly equip the vessel, conduct adequate inspections, and provide proper management of the vessel. The city did not provide any evidence or examples to explain those allegations. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Coastguard�s Marine Board of Investigation have been investigating the incident since last month. The NTSB is expected to release a preliminary report into its probe in early May.\nReport 24: London, Apr 21 -- A press report, dated Apr 20, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i>: Salvage crews at the site of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore are turning their focus to the thousands of tons of debris sitting atop the vessel that veered off course and caused the deadly catastrophe last month. Officials said an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of steel and concrete landed on the vessel�s deck after it crashed into one of the bridge's supporting columns and toppled the span. Crews must remove all that before refloating the stationary vessel and guiding it back into the Port of Baltimore. So far, cranes have lifted about 120 containers from the vessel, with another 20 to go before workers can build a staging area and begin removing pieces of the mangled steel and crumbling concrete. The vessel was laden with about 4,000 containers and headed for Sri Lanka when it lost power shortly after leaving Baltimore. Six members of a roadwork crew plunged to their deaths in the collapse and two bodies remain unaccounted for. \nReport 25: London, Apr 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, recreational vessels will have another opportunity to navigate past the site of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, with the Coast Guard permitting passage on Sunday. This marks the second instance for boaters since the bridge fell three weeks ago. Reportedly, the Sollers Point Alternate Channel will be open for recreational vessels, accommodating one-way traffic into and out of the harbor during two separate 45-minute periods in the morning and two in the evening. Previously, recreational vessels were allowed to use the alternate channel on Tuesday, with more than 35 vessels, including sailboats and yachts, taking advantage of the opportunity to relocate their vessels. On Sunday, the temporary channel will be open for outbound vessels from 0630 hrs to 0715 hrs. Following this, from 0715 hrs to 0800 hrs, recreational vessels will be permitted to enter the harbor. In the evening, outbound vessels can transit from 1800 hrs to 1845 hrs, while inbound vessels will have access from 1845 hrs to 1930 hrs. Traffic around the Key Bridge had been restricted to recreational vessels until this week, with alternate channels primarily reserved for commercially essential vessels involved in clearing the wreckage.\nReport 26: London, Apr 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, officials in Maryland have opened a third shipping channel near the site of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. The Fort Carroll Temporary Alternate Channel on the northeast side of the main channel will provide limited access for commercially essential vessels, officials said in a statement Friday. Reportedly, the newest temporary route for vessels to navigate clear of the wreckage will allow for limited access for commercially essential vessels, officials said during an update.\nReport 27: London, Apr 20 -- A press report, dated Apr 19, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Dali<\/i> (IMO: 9697428), which allided with Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, United States on Mar 26: According to reports, the recovery efforts in Baltimore continue to make good progress, reporting that more than 1,300 tonnes of steel have now been removed from the waterway, said the Maryland Governor in the afternoon hours of Apr 19. While the priority remains on establishing a larger temporary channel to reopen Baltimore harbour, they also opened a third temporary channel while the teams were also beginning to converge on <i>Dali<\/i> for the effort to refloat and remove the vessel. The governor reported that each of the laden containers weighs between 1.5 and 2.5 tonnes and that, in addition, the salvage teams project that there are 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of steel from the bridge sitting on the bow of the vessel. After the containers were removed, they were planning to build a staging area to address the debris. Representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Coastguard reported that they were planning the effort to cut the sections of roadway and steel and remove them from the vess",

Moller-Maersk has settled its 44 million United States dollars lawsuit out of court a major lawsuit over the grounding of <i>Ever Given<\/i> in the Suez Canal in 2021. These included its operator Evergreen, Bernhard Schulte Ship Management, as well as its owners, Japanese company Shoei Kisen. Reportedly, the case has now ended. A Maersk spokesperson told �We can confirm that we have withdrawn the case in Denmark�.

The vessel, en route from the United Kingdom to China, entered the canal on Aug 20 among a convoy of 26 vessels sailing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. Reportedly, a group of SCA senior pilots and two tugboats escorted the <i>Ever Given<\/i> throughout its journey through the canal.\nReport 5: London, Aug 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>, en route from Felixstowe after unloading its cargo, has entered the Suez Canal again after arriving in Port Said the previous night. The vessel was passing through the Suez Canal accompanied by the tugs <i>Mosaed 1<\/i> and tug <i>Mosaed 2<\/i>. The vessel is now going to a repair yard in Singapore which has docks large enough to accommodate the ship.\nReport 6: London, Aug 4 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> docked at Felixstowe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, at 1630 hrs, Aug 3. The Port of Felixstowe said 2,000 containers were being unloaded by crane and the process would take about 24 hours.\nReport 7: London, Aug 4 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> sailed from Maasvlakte in Rotterdam after receiving bunker fuel on Aug 2.

The vessel�s arrival follows the progress on the legal process to settle cargo and property-related claims. The Port of Rotterdam said the arrival at its Delta terminal went \"according to plan\". The vessel's operator, Evergreen Marine, said it plans to unload European continental cargo at Rotterdam and trans-ship some containers to Hamburg on the 5,652-teu fully cellular containership <i>Ever Utile<\/i>. <i>Ever Given<\/i>�s next port of call will be Port of Felixstowe, United Kingdom, where the ship is scheduled to arrive on Aug 8. The vessel is expected to go for inspection and repair after its Felixstowe port call.\nReport 9: London, 29 -- According to Lloyds List Intelligence AIS, fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> arrived and moored in Rotterdam, Netherlands, at 1415 hrs, UTC, today.\nReport 10: London, Jul 27 -- A press report, dated Jul 26, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>, which blocked Suez Canal in Mar 2021, has additional delays and will therefore arrive in the port of Rotterdam one day later. The ship is expected to dock at a container terminal of the transshipment company ECT on Jul 29 at 0500 hrs and will remain there until Aug 3 for loading and unloading. Then it leaves for Felixstowe in England.\nReport 11: Kiel, Jul 21 -- The grounding of fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>, in the Suez Canal and the subsequent month-long stay in the Great Bitter Lkae have affected the ship more than what was expected. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), which examined it before it left Egyptian waters, found it only seaworthy to a limited extent. The ABS only allowed <i>Ever Given<\/i> to sail to Rotterdam at a reduced speed, and it was not allowed to call at Hamburg, which is only possible via a narrow passage in the Elbe. <i>Ever Given<\/i>, after a short time of interrupted sailing in the Mediterranean Sea, had sought refuge east of Sicily, where it drifted for several days in the wind with the engine stopped. The vessel has an ETA at Rotterdam as of Jul 25. -- Correspondent.\nReport 12: London, Jul 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>, which ran aground in the Suez Canal on Mar 23, refloated on Mar 29 and was stuck in Great Bitter Lake in the Canal due to disputes, before sailing off the Canal on Jul 7, reportedly will need repairs. After leaving the Canal, the vessel spent five days at Port Said undergoing a class survey carried out by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) before leaving for northern Europe on Jul 12. Evergreen reportedly admitted last week that the ship has to travel at lower speeds in order to follow the guidance outlined in its seaworthiness certificate. As a result, the decision was taken to drop the Ever Given�s Hamburg port call because of concerns surrounding navigation safety. What needs fixing, remains unclear. An ABS spokesperson was quoted in the press as saying: �ABS provided an initial assessment of the vessel prior to its departure from Egypt noting items that would require future repair. ABS, in conjunction with the flag state, issued short-term certificates for the voyage to Rotterdam and continues working with the owners regarding a repair plan.�\nReport 13: London, Jul 9 -- Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The <i>Ever Given<\/i>�s Master was solely responsible for the decisions and actions that led to the blockage of the Suez Canal, but the protracted three-month negotiation, which saw Egypt detain the vessel and its crew until an estimated $550m settlement was paid, was `amicable� and `everyone left happy�, according to the canal authority chairman Osama Rabie. Human error was the root cause of the grounding that blocked the Suez Canal for six days in March, but an incident of that scale will not happen again, said Admiral Rabie. Speaking to Lloyd�s List following the ceremony that saw <i>Ever Given<\/i> leave the canal�s Great Bitter Lake anchorage after three months of protracted negotiations, Admiral Rabie said lessons had been learned, investments in safety and salvage infrastructure had been made, and the estimated $550m settlement deal reached between all parties had in the end been �fair�. But ultimately he said that the vessel�s grounding was down to �human error� and pointed the finger of responsibility directly at the containership�s Indian Master. �Other factors could have affected such an incident such as the wind speed, for example, but we know the wind speed was not decisive in this incident, it was the problem of the pilot, of the vessel, of the master of the vessel. And the final decision is always with the master of the vessel.� Adm Rabie, however, disputes any suggestion that the pilots held any responsibility for the grounding. �There was no discrepancy between the two pilots � everyone shared their point of view on the bridge, that is true, but I would like to stress that it is the final decision is always the master�s decision alone. The pilot gives him his point of view, he gives him guidance, but it�s up to the master if he would like to comply with it or not,� he said. During the court case that ensued, Shoei Kisen�s legal team argued that the SCA was at fault for allowing the vessel to enter during adverse weather conditions and not providing tugs. Adm Rabie disputes this and points out that 12 other vessels of similar size had transited northbound in the same weather with no issues, while 32 vessels had managed the passage in the opposite direction. �In bad weather conditions the ship�s master has the authority to refuse to cross the canal and he can also ask to change the pilot at any point during the transit, which did not happen in this case,� he said.\nReport 14: London, Jul 9 -- A press report, dated today, states: The 25 Indian crew members on board fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> are happy that the vessel is sailing after nearly four months. The vessel finally sailed on Wednesday after it ran aground in the Suez Canal on Mar 23. The General Secretary of the Mumbai-based National Union of Seafarer of India (NUSI), said all the crew members were in touch with their families all through the period. With the owners entering into a financial settlement with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), the ship set sail again on Jul 7, the NUSI said. <i>Ever Given<\/i> will proceed to Port Said, Egypt, where a dive survey of the vessel will be completed. Subject to approval from the vessel�s classification society, <i>Ever Given<\/i> will complete its voyage to the next port, the shipowner added.\nReport 15: London, Jul 7 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> weighed anchor shortly after 1130 hrs, local time (0930 GMT) and headed north towards the Mediterranean escorted by tugs. The ship is finally leaving the waterway after Egypt signed a compensation deal with its owners and insurers. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. [According to Lloyd's List Intelligence AIS, <i>Ever Given<\/i>, which was arrested on Apr 13 by the Court in Egypt, sailed from its position in Great Bitter Lake on the Suez Canal waterway, at 0934 hrs, today, following the reported agreement reached between the Suez Canal Authority and the owners of the vessel last week. The vessel came to a stop at Km-151 while transiting the Suez Canal with the northbound convoy, on Mar 23 and blocked the canal for the next six days. Subsequently, <i>Ever Given<\/i> was refloated on Mar 29 and towed to Great Bitter Lake where it was anchored for investigations and remained there ever since, waiting for resolutions to disputes.]\nReport 16: London, Jun 20 -- A press report, dated today, states: The owners of fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> have reportedly made a new offer in the compensation dispute with the Canal authority, and a court ruling on the case was postponed for two weeks today, to allow more time for negotiations. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) demanded $916 million in compensation to cover the salvage efforts, reputational damage and lost revenue, before publicly lowering the request to $550 million. The <i>Ever Given<\/i>�s Japanese owners Shoei Kisen and its insurers have disputed the claim and the ship's detention under an Egyptian court order. Negotiations had been ongoing until Saturday and the ship's owners had made a new offer, SCA lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr told a court hearing over the ship's detention in Ismailia. Stann Marine, which represents the owners and insurers of <i>Ever Given<\/i>, said: \"Over the course of more than 15 days and in extended, long and arduous, but positive working sessions, negotiations are taking place. During the negotiations we submitted a proposal that we believe satisfies all the requirements of the SCA,\" it said in a statement, adding that the details would remain confidential. The SCA's chairman previously said Shoei Kisen had offered to pay $150 million. A court ruling was due on Sunday after several delays, but Stann Marine said it had asked for an adjournment.\nReport 17: London, Jun 11 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: A spokesperson for the law firm Clyde & Co, which represents producers of more than 100 million US dollars worth of cargo on board the vessel has stated that some of their customers are outrage due to the cargo situation, as the vessel is unable to sail out of Egyptian waters until the problem is resolved. Although the cargo remains officially detained, physically removing it from the gigantic ship is unlikely to become an option as it requires equally gigantic cranes to move it, at a port deep enough to accommodate such a large vessel. Also, Dixons Carphone, Lenovo and Ikea separately confirmed that their products remained trapped on the ship. �A small number of our containers remain on the Ever Given vessel, however there is no meaningful disruption to our stock levels or business operations,� said a Dixons Carphone spokesperson. Some retailers are considering legal action against the Egyptian authorities to try to free their cargo.\nReport 18: London, Jun 6 -- A press report, dated Jun 5, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) rejected claims made by the vessel's insurer, and said that exceeding set speeds at the Suez Canal is the sole responsibility of the ship captain, on Jun 5. In a statement, the SCA said that vessels crossing Suez Canal are subject to a set speed of 14 to 16 kilometres per hour according to the type of the transiting vessel according to Article 54 of the Navigation Book of Rules. It added that Article 58 stipulates that the SCA shall assign two escorting tugs to container ships carrying a tonnage of 170,000 tons and above, adding that such a rule was applied to Ever Given. According to the aforementioned, the vessels shall comply with the stated speed following the Navigation Book of Rules when transiting the canal; and exceeding these speeds is the sole responsibility of the shipmaster. The SCA�s statement comes a few days after the vessel�s insurer said that the speed of the Ever Given was controlled by the canal�s operator before it ran aground and blocked traffic in the Suez canal for six days in March.\nReport 19: London, Jun 5 -- A press report, dated Jun 3, states: The speed of fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> that blocked the Suez Canal in March was controlled by the Egyptian waterway�s operator before it ran aground, the vessel�s insurer said on Jun 3. The statement from UK Club came after the head of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said the ship was sailing too fast when it became grounded, but that the canal bore no responsibility. <i>Ever Given<\/i> is still being held in the canal while both sides continue compensation talks. The SCA initially demanded 916 million US Dollars in compensation from the Japanese owner but has since said it would be willing to accept 550 million US Dollars, including a 200 million US Dollar deposit to secure the ship�s release.\nReport 20: London, Jun 4 -- A press report, dated Jun 3, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The insurer of the vessel has stated that, the operators of the Suez canal were at fault for the vessel's excessive speed which caused it to run aground in the canal. It said, \"It is important to clarify that whilst the master is ultimately responsible for the vessel, navigation in the Canal transit within a convoy is controlled by the Suez Canal pilots and SCA vessel traffic management services. Such controls include the speed of the transit and the availability of escort tugs.\"\nReport 21: London, May 31 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: In a press conference conducted by the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for negotiating compensation claims held at Ismailia, on May 30, the Head of the SCA Investigation committee revealed that the high speed by the captain of the stricken vessel caused the incident. �When the ship entered the canal course at the southern entrance, it moved towards the right [near the eastern bank of the canal]. Then, the captain tried to bring it to the middle of the canal at a high speed with a wide angle of rotation, but the ship was pushed towards the north,� he said. �After that, the captain increased the speed again to move the ship from the north, but it went to the right and ran aground on the eastern bank of the canal. We also have to put into consideration that the ship is huge and responds slowly due to its giant size,� he added. �The captain had asked for many requests [during the incident]. He asked for eight demands in 12 minutes,� he said, noting that the captain had to reduce the speed instead of increasing it but he was confused in this situation. The head of the SCA Investigation committee also said that the ship had already sailed through the canal when it was heading to Asian countries, but the incident took place during the return journey, which is difficult more than voyaging from the northern entrance. \"The speed was 11.2 metres per second at a rate of 22 knots,\" he said, noting that two high speeds of 43 knots per hour and 40 knots per hour were recorded on the black box. It has also been reported that, the head of SCA Navigation Control Unit ruled out bad weather had a role in the incident, noting that already 12 vessels passed through the canal in the same convoy before the incident.\nReport 22: London, May 27 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> that got stuck in the Suez Canal in March was struggling to steer because of its high speed and the size of its rudder, and could have chosen not to enter the waterway in bad weather, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Chairman Osama Rabie said today. A legal team for Japanese owner Shoei Kisen disputes the vessel�s detention and the compensation claim and has said that the SCA was at fault for allowing the vessel to enter and not providing tugs. Rabie said the Captain could have held the ship back. �He knows the capabilities of his ship � so he can come and say, `I don�t want to enter, I feel the weather is not appropriate,� he said in an interview at SCA headquarters in Ismailia. Before it became grounded, the giant ship was traveling at about 25 kilometres per hour, far above the 8-9kmh appropriate for the Canal�s narrow southern channel, Rabie said. Because of the speed, two tug boats accompanying the <i>Ever Given<\/i> were unable to help. �That speed was very high, and the rudder was not aligned,� he said. �There were a lot of technical faults, among those was that the rudder�s size was not appropriate to the size of the ship.�\nReport 23: London, May 27 -- Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: One person died, during efforts to salvage <i>Ever Given<\/i>, the Suez Canal Authority�s chair Osama Rabie has alleged. During the meeting with the Panamanian delegation, Mr Rabie highlighted the SCA�s efforts to refloat <i>Ever Given<\/i> after only six days, without any damage to the hull or the cargo on board. The statement alleged: �The shipowning company did not show the due recognition deserved, which did not reflect an understanding of the huge losses incurred by the authority due to the incident. That can be seen in the damage to a number of participating marine units and the sinking of one of the SCA marine units during the salvage operations, resulting in the death of one of the participants in the salvage operations.� No further details of the fatality, which did not feature in earlier reports, was provided. The canal also saw material losses on account of the suspension of navigation traffic and what it described as a �counter campaign� questioning the SCA�s ability to solve the crisis, the statement added.\nReport 24: London, May 27 -- A press report, dated May 26, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: According to reports, Egypt has offered to cut its compensation claim down to 550 million U.S. dollars against the impounded vessel that blocked the Suez Canal in March. �We reduced the value of the required compensation by 40 percent from 916 million U.S. dollars to 550 million U.S. dollars after we obtained the estimated financial value of the goods on the ship,� the canal authority chief said in a statement.\nReport 25: London, May 24 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chairman Osama Rabie indicated on Sunday that a $200m deposit could be enough to secure the release of fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>. Rabie said on Sunday that, the SCA could be willing to accept a reduced sum of $550m if an out of court settlement could be reached. The SCA is holding the vessel and its cargo in the Great Bitter Lake seeking a payout of $916m for damages and salvage costs stemming from the vessel�s grounding that blocked the waterway for six days in March. The $916m claim includes the costs of freeing the ship and a salvage bonus stipulated in maritime law, alleged material and reputational damage, and the diversion of some shipping away from the canal. Shoei Kisen filed an appeal with a court in Ismailia on Saturday to have the claims against the vessel thrown out during Saturday�s hearing. The SCA has steadfastly denied responsibility for <i>Ever Given<\/i>'s grounding, claiming that all responsibility lay with the ship's captain alone. Although the SCA has kept an iron grip on the vessel, it has shown a willingness to negotiate the claim amount.\nReport 26: London, May 23 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: An Egyptian court rejected today a complaint by the Japanese owner of fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i> against the vessel�s continued detention by the Canal authorities, a lawyer said. The complaint was attached to a case at the economic appeals court in Ismailia in which the Suez Canal Authority is seeking $916 million in compensation from the vessel�s owner Shoei Kisen, over the blockage and the operation to free the ship. Today, the court referred the case back to a court of first instance, which is due to consider it on May 29, said one of the lawyers representing the owner.\nReport 27: London, May 15 -- Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: Cargo interests will find it hard to recover losses arising from delay as a result of the <i>Ever Given<\/i> grounding, which forced the closure of the Suez Canal, according to a client advisory from Clyde & Co. The law firm gives the example of the Institute Cargo Clauses and the Grain and Feed Trade Association standard insurance contract, known as GAFTA 72, under which the majority of the world�s bulk grain consignments are shipped. Loss, damage or expense proximately caused by delay is generally excluded in both cases. The contractual remedies available to cost, insurance and freight sellers and free on board buyers as charterers against owners are also limited. Subject to market freight rates, charterers may elect to exercise their right to cancel if a vessel fails to meet its laydays and cancellation clause. Charterers may also look to the terms of their charterparty to determine whether any claim for damages lies against the shipowner for failure to proceed to the load port with reasonable dispatch, or for breach of `estimated ready to load� or `estimated time of arrival� statements. They should check the precise wording of their charterparty, including any exception clauses applicable to laytime and demurrage, to determine when the vessel is deemed to be an arrived ship for the purposes of triggering laytime. Claims for demurrage will in the first instance be borne by charterers, who will in turn seek to pass them on to their counterparty. Whether they can do so or not will depend upon the terms of the sale contract. It may be difficult to pursue a claim in deviation against an owner who opted to take the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope during a laden voyage, rather than queue for the duration of the grounding. Charterers considering exercising cancellation rights should seek legal advice to ensure they do not commit a repudiatory breach of contract. FOB and CIF buyers are reminded that the contract goods are shipped at their risk and this includes transit delays. Until a full investigation has been carried out as to the cause of the grounding in March, it is unclear whether the vessel's cargo interests will have a right to claim in respect of loss or damage, or a defence to a claim for general average, Clyde & Co advises. But the vessel�s owners have filed a limitation action before the English Admiralty Court to cap exposure to claims for loss or damage to property at around $115m.\nReport 28: London, Apr 29 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: Three crew members aboard <i>Ever Given<\/i> will be allowed to return home, the ship's manager said today. \"Our utmost priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our crew. We are in regular contact with them and their families, offering all necessary support,\" said Ian Beveridge, the CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM). Two other crew members left the ship earlier in April, due to urgent personal circumstances. <i>Ever Given<\/i> remains anchored in Great Bitter Lake, in position lat 30 22 17N, long 32 22 41E, as of 1355 hrs, today.\nReport 29: London, Apr 28 -- Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The head owner of <i>Ever Given<\/i> is seeking to cap limitable claims at just $115m. That is far below the $916m compensation sought by the canal authorities and unknown substantial claims from other impacted ships. Resort to the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976, known in industry as LLMC 76, was widely expected in shipping law circles. However, the key wording is `limitable claims�. The extent to which Egyptian demands are in fact limitable is unclear, and likely depend on local law, according to legal experts. The move comes after a prominent London-based shipping law firm earlier this month formally served notice of limitation proceedings on a lawyer acting for another owner hit by the fallout from the casualty. HFW is acting for <i>Ever Given<\/i>�s joint owners, Luster Marine and Higachi Sangyo Kaisha, both associated with Japan�s Shoei Kisen Kaisha, in all matters except for the salvage operations of professional salvor Smit. Taiwanese boxship major Evergreen operated <i>Ever Given<\/i> on charter, under the technical management of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. �Anyone who has a claim against the owners have been referred through the liability insurers [the UK Club], giving us formal notice that a limitation fund has been established in London,� said the lawyer. Under the LLMC, a ship may limit liability according to tonnage, except where it is proved that loss resulted from �personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such a loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result.� Breaking limits only occurs with extreme rarity. A High Court order allowing <i>Ever Given<\/i>�s owners to set up a limitation fund was granted on Apr 8, in the amount of 81,563,858 special drawing rights, which equates to roughly �83m, or $115m. Under a limitation fund arrangement, claims that can be proved are paid out from the fund pro-rata, making vessel arrest largely superfluous. <i>Ever Given<\/i> is now at anchor in the Great Bitter Lake and the status of the crew is unclear; only two have been allowed to leave the vessel for compassionate reasons. The owners have filed an appeal before the Ismailia court of first instance against the vessel and cargo arrests, which will be heard on May 4.\nReport 30: London, Apr 22 -- Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The International Transport Workers� Federation has demanded that around two dozen Indian seafarers still on board <i>Ever Given<\/i> be allowed to leave the ship. The call from the seafarer trade union umbrella organisation comes after the Egyptian government allowed two of the crew to go, in what it called a humanitarian gesture. It is not clear on what grounds the two were selected. A spokesman for technical manager Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which employs the crew, said that no arrest proceedings have been issued against any crew members. However, they are not being permitted ashore. The ITF said in a statement that representatives had accessed the ship, currently anchored in the Great Bitter Lake, to check on the health and welfare of those on board. �We are pleased to inform the world that the crew of the <i>Ever Given<\/i> is in good spirits, and doing well,� said its regional official Mohamed Arrachedi. The fate of the seafarers is dependent on a resolution of the dispute between the SCA and the owner and its insurers, he added. Mr Arrachedi said no wage or contract violations had been unearthed by the ITF representatives, and all crew had been paid for March. Food provisions are sufficient, and the ITF has delivered devices to allow for internet connections. �We continue to monitor the situation and the crew know we are available to support where needed,� he said. Demands for the seafarers� release were echoed by the the National Union of Seafarers of India, which is currently negotiating with the employers and the Egyptian authorities.\nReport 31: London, Apr 16 -- A press report, dated Apr 15, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: The arrest procedures are said to have been initiated against <i>Ever Given<\/i> which had blocked Egypt's Suez Canal and crippled world trade for nearly a week. The CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the technical managers of the containership called the arrest procedures \"disappointing\" since the crew members on board were cooperating with the investigations. \"From the outset, BSM and the crew members on board have cooperated fully with all the authorities, including the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) and their respective investigations into the grounding. This included granting access to the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) and other materials and data requested by the SCA. BSM�s primary goal is a swift resolution to this matter that will allow the vessel and crew members to depart the Suez Canal,\" said Ian Beveridge, CEO of BSM. Currently, <i>Ever Given<\/i> is anchored in Great Bitter Lake, between two sections of the canal, since being dislodged on Mar 29 and is caught in a legal row linked to a $916 million compensation claim made by SCA against the vessel�s owner. Two of its 25-member Indian crew aboard has been allowed to return home, due to some personal reasons, on Apr 15.\nReport 32: London, Apr 14 -- A press report, dated today, states: Fully cellular containership <i>Ever Given<\/i>: According to the vessel�s insurer, the UK P&I Club, Shoei Kisen has been hit with 916 million Dollars claim from the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). Evergreen stated in a release that the claim includes 300 million Dollars claim for salvage bonus and 300 million Dollars for �loss of reputation�. �During the meeting between the shipowners a",

The newly promoted engineer, who was working on an auxiliary engine fuel filter, had not effectively isolated the fuel system, and both he and an adjacent auxiliary engine�s hot exhaust were sprayed with fuel under pressure. The fuel spray penetrated the exhaust insulation and ignited. Prompt actions by the crew closed down the space to limit the spread, MAIB said. But one crew member died nine days later from the effects of smoke inhalation. The investigation found that, despite the vessel having a full range of safe systems of work in place, the third engineer, who had worked for the company for over five years, died while attempting an \"unnecessary job conducted in an unsafe way at an inappropriate time\". There was no risk assessment or direct supervision. An analysis of the third engineer�s training programme activity log found that only two of the 65 rank-specific tasks he was required to undertake before his promotion to third engineer had been completed with the requisite evidence. MAIB also found that the training system permitted line management to confirm that training had been completed without evidence being provided. \"This facilitated his promotion twice when he was not ready,\" the report said.\nReport 2: Kiel, Dec 30 -- Liquefied petroleum gas carrier <i>Moritz Schulte<\/i> after completion of repairs left the shipyard at 1100 hrs, Dec 17.

The vessel was completing the mooring operations with final adjustments being made by taking in the mooring lines with winches and maneuvering the vessel from the pilot house. During this evolution, an ordinary seaman was standing near a steel wire being used as the #4 mooring line, when the 3rd mate operated the winch to bring tension to that line. The steel line tightened, causing the line to abruptly jump up and strike the ordinary seaman on the shoulder and head area, causing the crewmember to be flung in the air and then land on his right shoulder and back; initial estimates of the injury was a broken hip, but was later determined to be a dislocation. The ordinary seaman was transported to a local hospital for medical attention and then transferred again to another hospital for specialized care. No additional injuries were sustained or other incidents resulted from this casualty.\n\nThe Captain, who was at the helm at the time of the incident, and the 3rd mate, who controlled the winch and who ultimately caused the injury, were drug and alcohol tested; the alcohol test was delayed due to misunderstanding by the vessel Captain and by the time the test was conducted, it was late. The injured crewmember was unable to test in time due to his medical treatment including movement to another hospital. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the mooring line striking the ordinary seaman, causing injury.  The causal and human factors that contributed to this casualty include: 1) inexperience on the part of the 3rd mate who did not maintain control of the situation on deck prior to engaging the winch; 2) language barrier between the 3rd mate and ordinary seaman as the 3rd mate was attempting to tell the ordinary seaman to move in English; the 3rd mate's primary language is Bengali and the ordinary seaman's primary language is Filipino; 3)lack of oversight by a more experienced crewmember due to the inexperience of the 3rd mate.\n\nIAW ALCOAST 186/20, this investigation has been downgraded to a data collection.",

      "incident_precis": "On the morning of June 12, 2020, the Chemical Tanker OPERA (IMO 9804887) pulled up to pier 5 at the port of Vancouver, Washington. With the vessel alongside the pier, and the assist tugs still attached, the aft spring line was passed from the vessel to the pier and attached to a bollard on the pier. During the process, the mooring line drooped into the water between the vessel and the pier. The vessel master gave the order to the 2nd officer, who was in charge of the aft mooring station, to take the slack out of the aft mooring line using the aft winch on the vessel. The 2nd officer gave the hand signal to an AB that passed the signal to the winch operator. As the slack was being taken out of the line, the vessel shifted and touched the pier pinching the mooring line between the pier and the vessel. The winch was still engaged and tension was placed on the mooring line pinched between the vessel and the pier. The Master noticed that the line was pinched and requested the Pilot communicate to the aft tug to slowly pull the vessel from the pier in order to clear the line out. The 2nd Officer was standing with his head over the side of the vessel. When the mooring line became un-pinched, the mooring line jumped up with force and hit the jaw and right arm of 2nd Officer at 1237PDT. The force of the impact knocked the 2nd officer to the deck. Shoreside EMS was contacted and the 2nd officer was removed from the vessel and taken to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment. The 2nd officer was given stitches for a chin laceration, and diagnosed with a minor concussion. X-rays were taken of the right arm and it was revealed that nothing was broken. The 2nd officer was given a tetanus shot and lidocaine. The 2nd officer was returned to the vessel the same day and removed from duties for 1 to 2 days.\n\nIAW ALCOAST 100/20, this investigation has been downgraded to a data collection.",

      "incident_precis": "On January 8, 2020, at approximately 1630 CST, the Third Engineer on the oil tanker M/V SOUTHPORT was injured after his right-hand little finger was struck with a hammer. At the time of the casualty, the M/V SOUTHPORT was at the Port Aransas anchorage and was conducting routine maintenance on the #3 cylinder of the main diesel engine. Prior to commencing maintenance operations, the Chief Engineer conducted a safety meeting where he explained the maintenance procedures in accordance with the vessel’s safety management system. The maintenance consisted of removing seized nuts in order to remove the cylinder cover to conduct the unit piston decarb. The maintenance procedure required the Chief Engineer to provide hydraulic jack pressure to help the Third Engineer, who was holding a chisel, and the Second Engineer, who was hammering the chisel, to loosen the seized nuts. As the Chief applied pressure, the Second Engineer would strike the chisel rod. In order to effectively remove the nuts, the Second Engineer was required to strike the chisel with maximum force. At the safety meeting, the Chief Engineer provided instruction on how to safely conduct the maintenance and the responsibilities of each crew member during the evolution. Both the Second and Third Engineers were experienced sailors and had conducted similar maintenance with the same crew multiple times. The Third Engineer was outfitted with heavy leather gloves to mitigate injury. The chisel was approximately 10 inches long and 1 inch in diameter; however, the chisel did not have a handguard. The hammer was a heavy duty steel drill hammer that was approximately 15 inches long. At the conclusion of the safety meeting, all crewmembers signed the maintenance procedure sheet.\n \nAt approximately 1330, the maintenance commenced. At approximately 1630, after removing three seized nuts, the Second and Third Engineers were attempting to free a highly-seized nut when the Second Engineer missed the chisel rod and struck the Third Engineer’s lower right hand. At the time of the injury, the Third Engineer was kneeling with his back towards the engine and the front of his hand facing outwards. The Third Engineer was bent over facing the Second Engineer. Neither the Chief Engineer nor the Second Engineer noticed the Third Engineer do anything that was unsafe or not in accordance with the maintenance procedure. Likewise, the Chief Engineer did not report any unsafe acts by the Second Engineer. All crewmembers were wearing required personal protective equipment, although the Third Engineer was not wearing Kevlar protected anti-impact gloves. The crew was not rushed and had ample time to complete the maintenance.  \n \nOn January 9, 2020, at approximately 1400, the crewmember was sent ashore for professional medical treatment at the Doctors Center in Corpus Christi, Texas. Following x-rays, physician examination, and 12 sutures, the crewmember was diagnosed with a fractured right-hand little finger and was ordered not to use his right hand. Based on this diagnosis, the vessel Master determined the crewmember was unfit to perform routine vessel duties and sent him home for further evaluation. In addition, the master directed alcohol and drug testing for the injured crewmember.\n \nThis activity was categorized as an informal investigation because the initial report from the vessel’s agent was that the crewmember’s right hand may have been was fractured in addition to his little finger. However, subsequent medical records indicate that the crewmember’s little finger was the only bone that was fractured. Furthermore, initially, the laceration looked to be controllable and it was not believed there were any broken bones that would require treatment beyond first aid that would trigger required alcohol and drug testing for a serious marine incident. As such, alcohol testing was not directed for either the Third or Second Engineer. However, once the Master became aware that the injury required sutures and would likely render him unfit to perform his duties, the Master deemed the casualty a serious marine incident and directed alcohol and drug testing.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the hammer striking the Third Engineer’s hand. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) failure of the company to implement maintenance procedures that required the use of a handguarded chisel, (2) the latent unsafe condition of using a non-handguarded chisel, (3) the latent unsafe condition of using an undersized chisel, (3) inadequate supervision of the Third Engineer by allowing him to expose the front portion of his hand to the hammer, and (4) absence of Kevlar protected anti-impact safety gloves that would have likely prevented the Third engineer’s finger from fracture and laceration even when struck with a hammer.",
